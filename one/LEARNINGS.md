# Day 1
This problem is gave me the opportunity to explore some of the Go standard library. Although somewhat of a limited use case, I was able to get a feel of writing Go code and the tooling around it.

## Approach
For Day 1, the goal is to find the first and last occurence of a single digit in each line of a string, concatenate them and add the integer value of each line of the input file.

See the `main.go` file for inline comments around the approach.

## Learnings
The aspects of the standard library that I explored were: "os", "fmt", "bufio" and "strconv".
### "os"
Main use case was reading the input from a file that was provided by AoC.
There are a few ways to read content of a file. The first and obvious one is to use os.ReadFile. This 
### "fmt"
### "bufio"
### "strconv"
### Regular Expression Matches Don't Overlap

## GoCoach
The concepts I wanted to understand while completing day 1's task was around how error handling worked in Go in comparison to languages like TypeScript and Java which I'm more familiar with. Additionally, I wanted to understand the go approach to some programming fundamentals like string manipulation and regular expression usage.
