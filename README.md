# Advent of Code 2023

## Goals
* Finally give advent of code a good try
* Learn to write Go
* Write about the learnings for each task

## Learnings
I'm 16 days late to starting this years advent of code and I'm not entirely sure how long I'll go for.

Before diving into this years AoC, I wanted to set some ground rules and thoughts around how I'd approach it.
1. I'm learning a new language (Go)
2. I'm only using the standard library that ships with Go
3. I'm not peeking into other peoples solutions
4. I will keep performance in mind while I tackle each day and document the considerations I make with regards to:
   1. Code organization
   2. Scale
   3. Learning Experience

### A note on completion tools.
For this AoC I've disabled CoPilot and I am not using any completion tools to help write the code. Instead, I created a GPT specifically for explaining Go concepts. That'll be my go to outside of the Go documentaiton for learning Go. For each day, I'll share the prompts I passed to [GoCoach](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-FkD45PZdt-gocoach).
